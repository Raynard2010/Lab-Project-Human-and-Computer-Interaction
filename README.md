Disclamer
----------
This project contains a lot of texts and pictures that aren't mine. I just took them from the internet. All the sources are in the Documentation + References file.

This project was not made very well. It was made not responsive, thus it may look weird when viewed on a device that doesn't have the same dimension as the device that I used. Thank you for understanding.

This project may be ugly but I hope it can be useful in one way or another.
